"""Simple, deterministic chunker.

Splits text into fixed-size, overlapping segments (values from the config).
Size is measured in characters – deliberately kept simple for the PoC.

Each chunk carries its character offsets (``start``/``end``) into the exact
text that was passed in, so ``text[start:end] == chunk.text``. Those offsets
are what enables highlighting a hit inside the original document.
